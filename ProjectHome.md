An embarrassingly stupid game I wrote back in 1998 for fun when I first learned Java during college.  Remember that horrible Java 1.0 AWT Event model before Sun completely rewrote it?  Remember when Applets were all the rage?  Aw yeah, this code is an example of that history.  Welcome to the trippy, crazy, goofy, psychedelic world of Poopie Wars!
